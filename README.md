#Movie Theater Manager

####Short description
Application allows to manage creating Events in different Auditoriums.
You can:
* create Event
* create Auditoriums for Event
* create a pool of seats and VIP seats in chosen Auditorium
* book a set of tickets
* for sure you you can rate a movie
* prolong your Event for multiple days and etc. 

As a manager of Movie Theater Manager you can manipulate all this data.
For sure, all operations are verified and validated when they occur.  

As a user you can add new Event and setup the following details:
* set a list of dates (airDates) with Auditoriums for planning Events 
* set a rating for this Event: high, medium, low
* base price for a ticket

Also you have the opportunity to manipulate Auditoriums by adding them with setting:
* name
* number of seats
* VIP seats

Each potential User with name, email and id can book a ticket on Event using BookingService with following API:
* remove
* getUserByEmail
* save

We have some additional service DiscountService for getting discount during purchases.
